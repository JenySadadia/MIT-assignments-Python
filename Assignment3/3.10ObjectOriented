1.What is the difference between a local variable and an objectâ€™s attribute?
ans:Local variables are variables used within a method; an object's attributes are variables that
    can be used be used throughout the entire object, regardless of the method in which it is
    first defined. However we usually wish to define attributes within the __init__ method.

2.What method is called when the object is created?
ans:__init__ (self, ...)

3. If you have an object instance, obj, and you want to call its do_something() method
(assuming it has one), how would you do this? (write the line of code you would use)
ans:obj.do_something()
